# SQL-Walmart-Analysis
A basic SQL project where we analyze some data from Walmart

Goal: 
  Explore the Walmart Sales data to gather information regarding sales trends, branch performance, and customer behavior in order to try and understand what could affect certain factors such as sales, ratings, and busyness.

Steps:
  1. Data Wrangling: A quick inspection of the data to make sure it is in usable format.
       Create a Database and insert data without any NULL values
  2. Feature Engineering: Generate new columns from existing data in order to get some easier-to-read data and some columns that will come in handy in the future.
       time_of_day, month_name, and day_name columns
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using the cleaned and processed data to answer some business-related questions.
